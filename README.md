A repository to keep track of any future project ideas 


## Climbing advisor
This app will take in some basic information from the user such as location, hardest red point, etc and return a list of climbs in the vicinity that could be possible climbing projects. Basically a smarter search for Mountain project, using mountain project's API: <https://www.mountainproject.com/data>

 - Proposal: user profiling for routes suggestions.

## TrickAdvisor
For my fellow Trickster! This app will show all the active grass session in the city. Users will select a spot and organize a session (public or private) or join one. If the session in public, everybody will be able to join to communicate their presence and skill level. If the session is private only the user's friendz will be able to see it. At the end of the session, users will be asked to rate the place with few parameters (ground, availability, reachability, etc) and an overall rating will be assigned to the spot. Trickerz unite!
